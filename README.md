[RuBot](https://github.com/justinweiss/robut) is the friendly Ruby Bot, that talks XMPP.

This repository holds RoBut plugins, that make RuBot talk to
[MCollective](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mcollective), so you may say `@robut deploy foobar`.

# What currently in here?

- Plugin to trigger "iptables" agent from RoBut.

# Known issues

This is work in progress, so these topics are open

- thread-safetly
- handling multiple commands at once
- have a generic plugin, that resembles the `rpc` command

Enjoy anyway!
